Title: The U.S. military is operating in the air, on land and at sea

The U.S. military is operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel. The Israeli government has, in turn, repeatedly called for this limited U.s. involvement to be considerably expanded. All of this has caused a split within the MAGA camp, writes Julian Zelizer, with Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson and others warning of the dangers of increased U.K.-Iranian involvement. If this conflict doesn’t end soon, it could spiral into a regime-change war involving the U.N. Security Council, says Peter Bergen. The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet next week to discuss the situation in the Middle East, including the possibility of a resolution to the Iran nuclear issue, which Israel has called a “red l l’ The current campaign looks like Israel’s previous assaults on terrorist groups, with covert operations and airstrikes targeting leadership and assets, says Bergen, who says Israel could have interpreted deterrence as “you can”t really get to us, but we can get to you’ But apparently Israel took it as indication Iran was vulnerable, and they should attack, Bergen says. The U.n. Security council has called for an end to the Israeli-Iranian conflict by the end of the year, but no action has been taken yet, he says.  The United Nations Security Council also has called on Israel and its allies to refrain from any further attacks on Iran, saying the situation is “at a critical stage” and that “all options are on the table” for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The popular libertarian figure was Dave Smith, who spoke at the convention before Trump in an unsuccessful bid to discourage libertarians from nominating a presidential candidate of their own. He says, “I’m sorry, Mr. Trump. I’ve got to tell you,” Smith said. Just before the election, Trump personally called Smith to encourage him to give a respectful speech.
