Title: The U.S. military is operating in the air, on land and at sea

The U.S. military is operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel. The Israeli government has, in turn, repeatedly called for this limited U.s. involvement to be considerably expanded. All of this has caused a split within the MAGA camp, writes Julian Zelizer, with Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson and others warning of the dangers of increased U.K.-Iranian involvement. If this conflict doesn’t end soon, it could spiral into a regime-change war involving the U.N. Security Council, says Peter Bergen. The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet next week to discuss the situation in the Middle East, including the possibility of a resolution to the Iran nuclear issue, which Israel has called a “red l l’ The current campaign looks like Israel’s previous assaults on terrorist groups, with covert operations and airstrikes targeting leadership and assets, says Bergen, who says Israel could have interpreted deterrence as “you can”t really get to us, but we can get to you’ But apparently Israel took it as indication Iran was vulnerable, and they should attack, Bergen says. The U.n. Security council has called for an end to the Israeli-Iranian conflict by the end of the year, but no action has been taken yet, he says.  The United Nations Security Council also has called on Israel and its allies to refrain from any further attacks on Iran, saying the situation is “at a critical stage” and that “all options are on the table” for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The popular libertarian figure was Dave Smith, who spoke at the convention before Trump in an unsuccessful bid to discourage libertarians from nominating a presidential candidate of their own. He says, “I’m sorry, Mr. Trump. I’ve got to tell you,” Smith said. Just before the election, Trump personally called Smith to encourage him to give a respectful speech.

Title: Donald Trump compared Russia and Ukraine to two fighting children who needed to work out their differences

Donald Trump compared Russia and Ukraine to two fighting children who needed to work out their differences for a while before anyone could intervene. It is unhelpful to compare this conflict to a dispute among children on a playground, and Trump complaining about anyone engaging in juvenile behavior is unwise, given everything we know about his temperament and frequent tantrums. Trump’s Plan A for the war in Ukraine was ending the conflict within 24 hours by way of a secret strategy he assured voters was real. When it became clear that the strategy wasn’t working, Trump changed his mind. The idea that the White House is prepared to let Russia and. Ukraine “fight for awhile” overlooks the inconvenient fact that they’ve already been fighting for a. while. Trump sparked backlash on Monday for defending Russian President Vladimir Putin during remarks at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Canada. The U.S. president complained to reporters, in front of fellow world leaders, about Russia's absence from the group of leading industrialized nations. “The G7 used to be the G8,” Trump began, “and I would say that that was a mistake because I think you wouldn’d have a war right now if you had Russia in.” Critics slammed his comments as yet another time he has sided with Putin amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. A bipartisan sanctions bill backed by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., would impose severe economic penalties on Russia and its supporters. The bill is expected to be voted on by the Senate this week and the House of Representatives next week. It's not clear if the Senate will vote on the bill or if the House will vote it in the next few weeks. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he asked President Donald Trump to put more pressure on Moscow. Merz met with Trump Thursday at the White house, his first visit to  the United States.
