Title: The U.S. military is operating in the air, on land and at sea

The U.S. military is operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel. The Israeli government has, in turn, repeatedly called for this limited U.s. involvement to be considerably expanded. All of this has caused a split within the MAGA camp, writes Julian Zelizer, with Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson and others warning of the dangers of increased U.K.-Iranian involvement. If this conflict doesn’t end soon, it could spiral into a regime-change war involving the U.N. Security Council, says Peter Bergen. The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet next week to discuss the situation in the Middle East, including the possibility of a resolution to the Iran nuclear issue, which Israel has called a “red l l’ The current campaign looks like Israel’s previous assaults on terrorist groups, with covert operations and airstrikes targeting leadership and assets, says Bergen, who says Israel could have interpreted deterrence as “you can”t really get to us, but we can get to you’ But apparently Israel took it as indication Iran was vulnerable, and they should attack, Bergen says. The U.n. Security council has called for an end to the Israeli-Iranian conflict by the end of the year, but no action has been taken yet, he says.  The United Nations Security Council also has called on Israel and its allies to refrain from any further attacks on Iran, saying the situation is “at a critical stage” and that “all options are on the table” for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The popular libertarian figure was Dave Smith, who spoke at the convention before Trump in an unsuccessful bid to discourage libertarians from nominating a presidential candidate of their own. He says, “I’m sorry, Mr. Trump. I’ve got to tell you,” Smith said. Just before the election, Trump personally called Smith to encourage him to give a respectful speech.

Title: The award was given to former President Jimmy Carter in 1977, and has never been given

President Donald Trump said Friday that he should've been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Former President Barack Obama received the award in 2009, and it is expected to be awarded again in 2020, when Trump will be in the White House for the first time in his first term. The award was given to former President Jimmy Carter in 1977, and has never been given to a sitting president since Ronald Reagan in 1980. Trump has said he will decide within a couple of weeks whether the U.S. military will get involved directly in the conflict between Iran and Israel. The White House declined to comment on the president’s comments Friday, but a spokesman said the Whitehouse is “comfortable’ with what he said” about the peace prize being given to the president in the future “if he chooses to accept it’ “I would think the Abraham Accords would be a good one, too,’ Trump added. The accords, a series of agreements signed between several Arab League nations and Israel, aimed to normalize relations between them to deescalate tensions in the Middle East. Foreign officials and national security experts criticized the accords at the time, arguing that they unfairly boosted Israel”s standing in the region while angering and isolating Palestine even further — and said the approach made Israeli-Palestinian peace less likely. No government can stop the rest of the world "going crazy", as one City source described it. But now, they added, "we have multiple genuine global crises", when even "one shock is enough to shift the goalposts". Abroad, conflicts rage – most notably, the years' long face-off between Israel and Iran that has exploded into a deadly and direct phase this week. And a belligerent Russia fighting war on the edge of our continent. The government has already promised it will spend more - a lot more - on protecting the country in the face of all those threats. But don't forget our supposedly trusted ally in theWhite House.
